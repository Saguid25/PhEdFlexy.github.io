        <p>As in most news throughout the paper, SPORTS articles and features are about people and the events that bring these people together. Reporters and columnists capture the challenge and rivalry, the business and promotion, the ethics and sportsmanship of teams and individuals. They observe, interview, record and analyze the statistics-and write on deadline. They enter the realm of pain, perseverance and possibility. </p>
